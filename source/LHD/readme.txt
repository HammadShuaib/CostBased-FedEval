Preparation:

Before executing queries using LHD you have to provide: 1) a file contains one or more queries (explained below), and 2) VoID files of SPARQL endpoints, saved in the folder 'stats' (examples are given in that folder).

LHD uses the same VoID files as SPLENDID does. VoID files can be generated by a tool provided with SPLENDID (probably you already have it). I also have my own tool to do this work (but again a fews tweaks are necessary to make it publicly usable). Please let me know if you need it. 

Execution:

The main entry is src.trunk.lhd

The engine can be used by typing (if under windows): java -c bin;lib\* trunk.lhd -q "path_to_query_file"
A query file contains one or more SPARQL queries, and with a query number under each query. The following example shows a query whose number is 5.

	# query number 5
	SELECT * {?s ?p ?o}
	query 5

Lines starting with a '#' are regarded as comments and ignored as well as blank lines. An example query file 'queries.txt' can be found in the directory. The order of queries is insignificant. If you need to run the same query for multiple times, simply provide several copies of the query, with query number following it.

Other parameters accepted by LHD are '-r' and '-i'.

With '-r' (stands for rest) LHD will take 10 seconds break between two queries of the same number, and 20 minutes between queries of different numbers.

With '-i' following numbers separated by ';' (e.g. lhd -i 3;4;5) will ignore queries with provided numbers.
